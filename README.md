## Requirements

Make sure that [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) is installed properly on your project.

Make sure that [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is installed properly on your project.

Make sure that [AlpineJS](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/) is installed properly on your project.

## Installation

You can install the Package using Composer

```bash
composer require ascsoftw/livewire-toast
```

## Usage

Put Livewire-component `@livewire('livewire-toast')` anywhere into your app layout.

You can then call the Livewire Toast as below:

*From Livewire Component*

```php
$this->emitTo('livewire-toast', 'show', 'Project Added Successfully'); //Will show Success Message
$this->emitTo('livewire-toast', 'showError', 'There was an Error!'); //Will show error. showError, showWarning, showInfo, showSuccess are supported
$this->emitTo('livewire-toast', 'show', ['type' => 'warning', 'message' => 'This is warning!']); //Can also pass type and message as array

```

*Using Session Flash*

```php
session()->flash('livewire-toast', 'Project Added Successfully');
session()->flash('livewire-toast', ['type' => 'error', 'message' => 'There was an Error!']);

```

*From Livewire View*
```php
$emitTo('livewire-toast', 'show', 'Project Added Successfully'); //Will show Success Message
$emitTo('livewire-toast', 'showError', 'There was an Error!'); //Will show error. showError, showWarning, showInfo, showSuccess are supported
$emitTo('livewire-toast', 'show', {'type' : 'warning', 'message' : 'This is warning!'}); //Can also pass type and message as object
```

*From JS*
```js
Livewire.emitTo('livewire-toast', 'show', 'Project Added Successfully'); //Will show Success Message
Livewire.emitTo('livewire-toast', 'showError', 'There was an Error!'); //Will show error. showError, showWarning, showInfo, showSuccess are supported
Livewire.emitTo('livewire-toast', 'show', {'type' : 'warning', 'message' : 'This is warning!'}); //Can also pass type and message as object
```


## Configurations

If you want to override the configurations, you must publish the assets using below command

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=config
```

This will publish the configuration file at `config/livewire-toast.php`. You can override any configurations.

You can also publish the View using below command
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=views
```

This will publish the Views in `resources/views/vendor/livewire-toast` directory which you can then customize.

## Troubleshooting
Your messages don't get styles while using TailwindCss? Please publish your view. Therefore Laravel Mix compiler will find package related views and will purge CSS accordingly.
